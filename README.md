# FoDS21-Demo

This repository was created during the Fundamentals of Data Science course at University of Potsdam in June 2021.

As a teaching assistant in the course I had the opportunity to add a new section

- on version control with git in R Studio
- why that is a good idea and
- what version control is in general.

The course happened remotely due to the corona virus pandemic. Therefore I recorded two video lectures where I discussed the contents of the slide deck that can be found in this repository.

The second one also acts as a step-by-step guide for using git in R Studio projects and was enriched by a lot of demo and concrete examples.

The contents of this slide deck are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license.
